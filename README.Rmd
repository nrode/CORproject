# CORproject

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CORproject is to conduct simple statistical analyses based on a table based on tabular data in PNG format. The data is read using optical character recognition based on the [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) package. The data is analyzed using an ANOVA. The analysis is summarized in a Rmd report.

## Installation

You can install the released version of CORproject from [GitHub](https://github.com/nrode/CORproject) with:

``` r
install_github("nrode/CORproject")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(CORproject)

## Simulate data and save it as png
createpng(csvpath="data/FitnessExperimentalDesign_G60Final.csv", outputpng="data/test.png")

## Read the data using OCR and output a vector
data <- ocrpng(impagepath = "data/test.png", n.col=NULL, lang="fra",  header=TRUE)

```
